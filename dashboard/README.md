To install k8s-dashboard we will be doing the following settings

1. Enable k8s-dashboard addon

```
microk8s enable dashboard
```

2. This will deploy k8s dashboard as a `ClusterIP` service. We need to update our host file with this info

```
YOUR_CLUSTER_IP k8s-dashboard.courtroom.local
```

3. To access this service we will need a token that can be generated by

```
kubectl create token default
```

4. The dashboard can be accessed at https://k8s-dashboard.courtroom.local
